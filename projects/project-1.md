In my 212 class at University of Hawaii at Manoa I created a Bank Database using C. It takes in your name, bank account number, address, and year of birth and then sorts the accounts by their account number.

Here is a link to the C source code: <a href="https://github.com/dankoo/dankoo.github.io/blob/master/projects/212bankdatabase/proj1.c">dankoo.github.io/projects/212bankdatabase</a>
