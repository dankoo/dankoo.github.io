I found that this project in 111, really helped me grasp what it was like to make a game with limited memory and computing power. This project helped me visualize what it is like to create a simple game, and understanding all the errors that were possible for a game to be created. Being that this was my first game that I've created, I felt that the experiences of researching and experimenting with coding helped me through the process of starting coding projects for my future assignments.
