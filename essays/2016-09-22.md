## We about to get deep with my boy Intellij!!!

  First, I'd like to say that Intellij is the ## BOMB.  I really like how the interface works fluidly and how the the IDE directs us to the best way to implement our code.  I truely feel a lot more safer being that we use Intellij with ESLint instead of using jsfiddle.  Being that the "coding standards" we use will typically  help us organize and neatly prepare our coding, and I am estatic to have this as our fundamentals.  Although every developer has their own style and "personality" behind their programing, I feel that if everyone was to use a coding standard, it would benefit all developers being that we will be able to look at a piece of code and not be so confused by it.
