I am interested and would like to understand the procedure of how softwares are created and how to efficiently execute successful software. Being that I have countless ideas and app ideas, I like to eventually start my own company and bring new and innovative apps that will make our everyday life easier.  I am interested in how softwares are tested and how they can be prevented from being attacked from a hacker.

I am looking forward to studying Cryptography; as much as it sounds intimidating I feel it would be very useful in the networking and security side of software engineering.  I feel that living in a world where every important information is stored on a machine, it is essential to know how encrypting and decrypting works.

As I am taking an Algorithms class this semester, and I would like to know how bad/good algorithms affect software.  I am looking forward to what professor Johnson thinks about algorithms and what kinds of things we need to know before going into a interview. By taking this class I hope that I'll be able to prepare/build myself for a promising career opportunities.
